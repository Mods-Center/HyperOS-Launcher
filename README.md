- If you use this in your ROM, please remember to credit our work.
- Not for paid ROMs.

### Important:
- Launcher mod is the one of the mod which consumes lot of time from me so please don't make another mod based on this work and let it remain however it is.
(If you all want future updates i.e.)
- Due to people taking mods from our apk and not even giving credits, extra folder grids and some more major mods have been removed and there's no plans to add them or any new mod again in future.

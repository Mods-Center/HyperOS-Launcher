# Launcher Mod v4 - FAQ

---

### **Q: Does Launcher mod v4 work for Android 14?**  
**A:** Yes, it works in Android 14, but some mods will be disabled as they are exclusive to Android 15 only.

---

### **Q: I don't have the dock option in the launcher.**  
**A:** Dock background customization only works for Android 15. Also, advanced textures must be enabled in your ROM (Display Settings or Launcher Settings → Force advanced textures).

---

### **Q: My Circle to Search isn't working.**  
**A:** There's an overlay in the module for unsupported ROMs. Make sure it's installed and enable "Circle to Search" from Navigation Settings.

---

### **Q: I saw several mods in screenshots, but I'm not getting all of them.**  
**A:** `Searchbar Provider` and `Hide Apps` features rely on the Xiaomi EU ext APK. If you only installed the launcher APK, install the additional APK from the ZIP. Other features depend on your Android version and the advanced textures option—ensure it's enabled in the settings.

---

### **Q: Are there 1x2 and 2x1 grids for folders?**  
**A:** Not yet. No current plans for this in Launcher v4, but it might be added in v5 (maybe in a year? xD).

---

### **Q: Can I use this module in a tablet (Pad)?**  
**A:** The mod was built for mobile. It hasn't been tested in tablets.

---

### **Q: Does it work on MIUI?**  
**A:** Maybe... but it's recommended to use the MIUI launcher mod instead of HyperOS mods on MIUI.
